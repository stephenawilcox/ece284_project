# Arrhythmic Heartbeat Classification Model
## ECE 284 Project - Spring 2025 
## Stephen Wilcox



Note that I did the project in the UCSD Jupyter Hub and there isnt an option to download the whole folder so I have only added the ipynb and none of the checkpoints.

The models tested in the paper are
final_basic_cnn.ipynb
final_se_cnn.ipynb
final_multilayer_cnn.ipynb
final_model.ipynb
